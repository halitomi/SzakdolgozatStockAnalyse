$VUZI promised AR glasses. I just want my money back.,-1
$SO seems to just drift. Steady dividend but no growth.,0

$TLRY went from “future weed king” to “why did I buy this again?”,-1
$ZIM looked like a dividend beast. Then they slashed it and the stock tanked. Should’ve just bought an actual boat.,-1

"Been debating between $V and $MA for months now. Both look solid, both have strong fundamentals. But neither has made a move big enough to break the tie.",0
$GOOGL ad revenue keeps climbing and YouTube is a cash cow. Bought during the DOJ fear dip and now I’m up nicely. The AI integration they’re doing with Gemini has serious long-term potential.,1
$SMCI hanging out after its huge run. Waiting for the next move.,0
"Bought $RENT because “clothing rental is the future.” Apparently, so is capital destruction.",-1
"Bought $ENPH after it dropped 50% and earnings surprised. Solar’s long-term bullish, especially with those tax credits.",1
"$BBBY was my worst trade of the year. I should’ve stuck to buying towels, not shares.",-1
Just got my $KO dividend and used it to buy more shares. Reinvesting soda money into soda stock. Let’s go.,1
$ETSY hovering in the same range. Still like the business model.,0
$CCL was supposed to benefit from the travel rebound. Instead I’m stuck underwater with no lifeboat.,-1
$BBIG reverse split. Guess what else reversed? My hope.,-1
Bought $AFRM at $120. It’s now $15 and I’m using Afterpay to buy groceries. The irony hurts.,-1
$ORCL kind of sitting still after earnings. Anyone long on this?,0
$WBA isn’t going anywhere fast. Probably fair value at this point.,0
"$TT is a sneaky industrial pick. Climate solutions, HVAC demand rising — I’m quietly up 45% and nobody’s even paying attention.",1
"Holding $PEP mostly for the dividend. Price doesn’t do much, which is fine — it’s more of a park-and-chill stock in my portfolio.",0
"$HIMS was supposed to be a growth beast. Instead, it’s balding faster than its customers.",-1
Bought $IONQ because it had “quantum” in the name. Turns out it had no profit in the plan.,-1
"$GOOG posted decent earnings and beat expectations, but the stock barely moved. I guess the market already priced it in. Thinking of holding, just not sure if now’s the time to add.",0

"Holding $COST and watching it chop sideways for weeks now. Great company, just not a lot of momentum in either direction lately.",0

"$CRM got smacked in 2022 and everyone said it was done. But they trimmed the fat, focused on margins, and now they’re growing faster than ever.",1
$ORCL was a boomer stock until they started pushing cloud and AI. Now I’m sitting on a 2x and thinking I misjudged old tech.,1
I picked up $ADP for the dividend but stayed for the stability. Every company needs payroll. They’re the HR backbone of the economy and they just keep growing.,1
$SENS was going to change diabetes management. All it changed was my net worth.,-1
Added $NKE to my long-term growth bag. China sales are rebounding and the product line is still fire.,1

I thought $ICCM would go viral. Turns out only my losses did.,-1
My $KODK “AI photo play” thesis was somehow dumber than it sounds.,-1

How do you guys feel about holding $BRK.B long-term? I’m on the fence.,0

Anyone else follow $DHR? Seems like a sleeper stock.,0
$NKE has good brand power but hasn’t moved much. Buy on dip or wait?,0

$BA still feels like it’s in recovery mode. Every bit of good news gets offset by delays or quality issues. Could go either way from here.,0

"$AVGO is a silent killer. Everyone’s focused on $NVDA and $AMD, but Broadcom just keeps printing earnings and stacking dividend increases. It’s like the Costco of semis.",1
Costco’s ($COST) earnings always hit different. Raised the membership fee and no one batted an eye. I swear they could charge $100 and I’d still pay for that $1.50 hot dog.,1
$ZM earnings came and went. No big reaction.,0

$SHOP chart is flat. Maybe accumulation phase?,0

$ICPT tanked faster than any liver disease they’re trying to cure.,-1
$MSFT has been consolidating around this price point. Could go either way.,0
Bought $MA and $V back when I first learned what a moat was. These two ARE the moat. They’re in every single transaction I make.,1

$KPLT sounded fintechy and modern. It was just broke and burning cash.,-1
"$MSFT feels like it’s in a holding pattern. They’re pushing Copilot and AI, but the market isn’t reacting much lately. Could be a quiet before the next run — or a plateau.",0
"Every time I check $DKNG it’s down again. Sports betting my ass, this is just gambling on red candles.",-1
Anyone else tracking $MCD? Keeps trading in a tight range.,0

Bought $HOOD thinking I was early on a fintech revolution. Turns out I was early to getting wrecked. Portfolio bleeding ever since.,-1

Bought $BCTX after seeing a Reddit DD. That due diligence was more like deep deception.,-1

$APPN looked like a sleeper AI play. It was just asleep... permanently.,-1
$TLRY was supposed to fly on legalization news. Instead it got baked into the floor.,-1

Looking at $KO — not much change despite recent earnings. Just chugging along.,0

"I bought $SHOP after it got bodied in 2022, and now it’s clawing back hard. E-commerce isn’t going away and Shopify is still the scrappy underdog I believe in.",1
"$ET is one of my favorite income plays. Natural gas flow, solid yield, and it’s finally breaking out of the $10–12 range.",1
"$VZ is finally turning around. I bought for the dividend but now I’m seeing actual gains. 5G taking its sweet time, but getting there.",1
YOLO’d into $SAVA because Reddit said “biotech moonshot.” Should’ve bought cheese instead.,-1
I bought $SMCI thinking it was just a quiet AI infrastructure play. Now it's all over CNBC and up 200%. Sometimes it pays to buy the boring behind-the-scenes players.,1
"$NDAQ is such a meta play. While we’re all trading, they’re collecting fees like the casino. I’ll gladly own the house.",1
